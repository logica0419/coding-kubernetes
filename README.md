# Coding Kubernetes

This is a hands-on tutorial for curious developers who want to understand Kubernetes by rebuilding its core—one bit at a time.
You'll implement a tiny Kubernetes-like system called **Kubitty**, complete with simplified CRI, CNI, and key control plane components, all written in Go.

> This project is **optimized for learning**, not for production.
> It won't run real workloads—but it *will* show you how Kubernetes really works.
> Don't let the rough edges stop you from diving in.

## Target Audience

This tutorial is for **intermediate to advanced developers** who want to understand how Kubernetes works by building its core logic from scratch.

You'll get the most out of it if you're familiar with:

- Go programming
- Containers and Linux basics
- Using Kubernetes at a user level
